# Sparkify User Churn Prediction
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project
 
Sparkify is a fictional music streaming platform created by Udacity. 
For this project we are given log data of this platform in order to drive insights and create a machine learning pipeline to predict churn. 

mini, medium and large datasets(only on AWS public) are available.
I have used medium scale data that I have processed with Spark on AWS EMR.
